<h2>
<strong>So, what's up with Minima?</strong> (a big post, 14/07/2012)</h2>

<p>Minima 1.0.1 was released 20 days ago, and it fixed some bugs and probably added some more. It also added an update system, but that’s <strong>IRRELEPHANT</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>When will 1.1 or 2.0 be developed?</strong></p>

<p>I don’t know yet, actually. I don’t even know what will be in the version, but I (with the help of awesome people from the linuxzasve.com forum), chose the codenames for 2.0 and a few version after, and they are, in no particular order: Dracula, Dalek, and Darby. (If you wondered, 0.6 was Cheesy, 1.0 didn’t have a codename, and 1.0.1 was Chihuahua)</p>

<p><strong>So, what’s up with the logo?</strong></p>

<p>The logo changed a lot in this three versions, and the 1.0/1.0.1 version was this:
<a href="https://github.com/iwebhub/minima-cms/raw/master/img/logo.png">https://github.com/iwebhub/minima-cms/raw/master/img/logo.png</a></p>

<p>But, the trouble starts with the demo logo:
<a href="http://minimademo.net84.net/img/logo.png">http://minimademo.net84.net/img/logo.png</a></p>

<p>It uses a different font (original was Georgia), and it’s quite different from the version above.</p>

<p>There will be a new logo in 2.0, and if you have a suggestion, leave a photo reply to this post. I will design one too, so we’ll have a battle. The text should be Minima or Minima CMS.</p>

<p>About fonts: Use only free/opensource/public domain fonts, and don’t use sites like dafont. A better place to start is Google Webfonts.</p>

<p>Your logo must be public domain, and don’t use any trademarks. (TM, R, C symbols are forbidden) </p>

<p><strong>2.0 in the works</strong> (not)
<em>We are working on bringing addons and themes fully to the new 2.0. Stay tuned for more :)</em> Friday, 29/06/2012</p>

<p><strong>And it's out!</strong>
<em>So, Minima 1.0.1 is, in fact, out! Grab it now! Also, we won't be updating the demo to it soon, because of some issues, but it's simple to install or upgrade, and full instructions and a package for upgrading will be up soon. I could talk about this for hours, but I won't. ;)</em> Sunday, 24/06/2012</p>

<p><strong>A quick update</strong>
<em>Minima 1.0.1 is almost done. Be patient, it will be great. :)</em> Sunday, 24/06/2012</p>

<p><strong>We moved here.</strong>
<em>With restrictions placed on 000webhost, our former host, we had problems, and they didn't say anything but "upgrade your account". So we moved here ;)</em> Thursday, 21/06/2012</p>
